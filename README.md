This React Native app is designed for people(mentee) who would like to network and receive advice from successful people(mentors) who have struggled through their current situation when immigrating. Using anoniminity for the mentors, they are able to offer guidance and feedback to anyone they match with using Machine Learning for that matching process. The matching process is based on country of origin, sex, language, education, and goals. 

This app  can be applied for immigration. Many people immigrate to the United States everyday, and coming to a new country without having any knowledge of the culture, and even language. Therefore, receiving advice from someone who has gone through the same process may be beneficial. Especially if they are trying to attend college and have no idea about the process such as SAT and application filing.

The same can also be applied to local communities with people that may be looking for advice and someone from that similar origin has similar interests.
